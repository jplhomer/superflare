title: Models (D1)
---

Models are a handy way to interact with your [D1 database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/). They provide a layer of abstraction between your database and your application, allowing you to define relationships between models and easily query for data.

D1 tables are created using native SQLlite migrations:

```sql
create table posts (
  id integer primary key,
  title text not null,
  createdAt timestamp not null default current_timestamp
  updatedAt timestamp not null default current_timestamp
);
```

Models are defined as TypeScript classes. Model class names correspond directly to the table names in the database. For example, a `posts` table would have a corresponding `Post` model:

```typescript
import { Model } from "superflare";

export class Post extends Model {
  toJSON(): PostRow {
    return super.toJSON();
  }
}

Model.register(Post);

export interface Post extends PostRow {}
```

Superflare provides utilities to help you keep your model's type definition in sync with your database.

Type definitions are created as an interface for each model and stored in `superflare.env.d.ts`. For example, the `Post` model will have a corresponding `PostRow` interface defined by Superflare.

{% callout title="Autogenerated types" %}
Do not manually modify any code within `superflare.env.d.ts`. It is automatically generated by Superflare and will be overwritten when you run `npx superflare migrate`.
{% /callout %}

When you migrate your database, Superflare will automatically update your interfaces to match the new database schema.

```
npx superflare migrate
```

When you create a new table in a migration, you can run the following command to generate a new corresponding model for the table with types:

```
npx superflare migrate --create
```

{% callout title="Generated types on build" %}
`superflare.env.d.ts` is gitignored by default. When running your Superflare app in a CI environment, you should run `npx superflare migrate` before attempting to build the project to prevent TypeScript errors.

## Registering Models

You must call `Model.register` after defining each model. This is how Superflare knows which models to load when you run [Jobs](/queues) and other background tasks.

## Creating Models

You can create a new model by running the following command:

```
npx superflare generate model Post
```

By default, a new model will be created in the `app/models` directory. You can change this by passing the `--path` flag:

```
npx superflare generate model Post --path app/my-models
```

You can also create a migration for your new model at the same time by passing the `--migration` or `-m` flag:

```
npx superflare generate model Post --migration
```
