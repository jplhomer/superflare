## Introduction

To deploy your Superflare app to production, you'll need to use `npx wrangler`. Superflare doesn't provide any helpers at this time.

## Checklist

- Make sure you've run D1 migrations against your production database before deploying with `npx wrangler d1 migrations apply <DB_NAME> --remote`.
- Make sure you've set an `APP_KEY` secret with `npx wrangler secret put APP_KEY`.
- If you're using `wrangler.json` to store your config, be sure to pass the `-j` flag after each `wrangler` command. I'm sorry, but I'm also not sorry.
